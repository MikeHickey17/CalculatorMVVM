# CalculatorMVVM

This is an exercise on MVVM (specifically with Prism). 

There's a complete function to ADD two numbers.

You are tasked to create similar functions for subtract/multiply/divide.

Ensure that a divide by zero is not possible to do.

Follow the template in the View and the ViewModels to finish this exercise.

This exercise is purposefully more open ended than the last exercises. For documentation on the prism library,
